# Build your own storybook

## What we will cover

* How to create your own isolated development setup

## Notes

Storybook is a very popular compliment to React projects but I try to avoid it.

Although I think the Storybook team works hard to maintain the project, Storybook
has often caused me a great deal of pain related to compatability issues with my
own Webpack setup or Babel version differences.

My coworkers like to emphasis a few benefits with Storybook:

1. A fast development experience
2. A isolated workflow that doesn't require you to run your application
3. An overview of the components in your application

At it's heart Storybook is just a wrapper around other tools
