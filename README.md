# Build your own storybook

## What we will cover

* How to create your own isolated development setup
* Why you may want to consider avoiding wrapper technology for big projects

## Notes

Storybook is a very popular compliment to React projects but I try to avoid it.

Although I think the Storybook team works hard to maintain the project, Storybook
has often caused me a great deal of pain related to compatability issues with my
own Webpack setup or Babel version differences.

At it's heart Storybook is just a wrapper around other tools and I have found
that for most needs I can build something that suits long running projects better
and has so far never caused me any issues.

In fact you may find that taking some time to do this will give you even
more development power than you would get from Storybook.
